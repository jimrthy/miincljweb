==========

Clojure web stack, with the bare-bones batteries
that seem useful to me.

It combines
* http-kit for actually processing the requests
* compojure for routing
* clostache for templating
* korma for the data layer
* sqlite under the hood

Usage
=====

Open up core.clj, start adding routes.

Caveats
=======

This probably won't be of any use to anyone but me. Still,
I did spend a few hours identifying these libraries and
making them work. So it seems like it might be worth tossing
out.
